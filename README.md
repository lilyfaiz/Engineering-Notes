**Data Warehouse** pulls in raw data from disparate sources. (could be production systems, logs, ...) Stores data in a clean, standardized form available for analysis. Generally a relational database that stores historic operational data from across the organization. Optimized to support complex multidimensional queries.

**Data mining** extracting value from data. General use cases are analysis and predictive modelling for future business endeavors.


## Three Data Mining Principles

1. Information discovered must be previously unknown.
2. Information must be valid. (Statistical testing)
3. Information must be actionable.

## Common Data Mining Analyses 

**Association Rules** Objects that satisfy condition X are likely to satisfy condition Y. Great for Market Basket Analysis (Group similar items), cross selling, catalogue design, store layout, financial forecasting, likelihood of illness.

**Sequential Pattern** Discovery of frequent subsequences in a collection of sequences, where order matters.  Web Traffic analysis, Market funnel analysis.

**Classification/Regression** Discovery of a function that maps objects into predicted values. Selective Marketing, Performance Prediction, Diagnosing Illness.
