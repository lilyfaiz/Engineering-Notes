# Chapter 1 Clean Code


A book about good programming.

## There will be code

The level of abstraction of languages will increase (coughcoughPython). Domain specif languages will grow.

Well-specified requirements are as formal as code and are executable tests of processes.

Code is the language of requirements.

## The total cost of owning a mess

With bad code, no change is trivial. One commit can break 2-3 other parts of the code. Every addition to the code requires more and more complex code to be understood. -> The longer this goes on the harder the code will be to change. 

Productivity decreases as time goes on. Pressure increases from management that worsens the problem.

## The grand redesign

Eventually the developers demand a redesign. Creates two teams, one maintaining and adding to the old system, another raing to redesign the old system to something new. The race goes on for a long time until the code base is as jumbled as the old system.

## What is Clean Code

Good code is __elegant__ and __works close to optimal__ (So others arent tempted to optimize it further). Good code __does one thing well__

Good code has __crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control__

Good code __can be read and enhanced by another developer__. Good code __has unit tests__. Good code is __minimal__.

Good code __minimizes duplication__. Good code is __expressed well__, with meaningful names and objects that don't do to many things.

Good code __reads to be exactly what you expect it to be__, good code __makes the language look like it was made for the problem__

__Good code focuses on expressiveness, little duplication, tiny abstractions__


## We are authors

Authors are responsible for communicating with their readers. They will judge your effort.

__You are constantly reading old code.__ Make the reading of code easy, even if it makes the writing harder.
